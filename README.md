Hi, I'm Federico, a Colombian Software Engineer that wants to become a computer science expert and traveling around the world in the process. So I am studying really hard every day to achieve this goal. When I entered the University of Los Andes four years ago in 2016, I didn't think that I will be here, having this dream and doing what I do, first I found a job as a software engineer aka junior consultant, then I started learning more about programming and some exciting technologies such as React, Nextjs, Javascript and so on. Now, I believe that I could do everything that I propose to myself. Also, I am learning English, although, It has been one of the most difficult things to learn and maintain I am encouraging myself to achieve this goal.
